Each utility returns a `Boom`\nerror response object which includes the following properties:\n- `isBoom` - if `true`, indicates this is a `Boom` object instance. Note that this boolean should\n  only be used if the error is an instance of `Error`. If it is not certain, use `Boom.isBoom()`\n  instead.\n- `isServer` - convenience bool indicating status code >= 500.\n- `message` - the error message.\n- `typeof` - the constructor used to create the error (e.g. `Boom.badRequest`).\n- `output` - the formatted response. Can be directly manipulated after object construction to return a custom\n  error response. Allowed root keys:\n    - `statusCode` - the HTTP status code (typically 4xx or 5xx).\n    - `headers` - an object containing any HTTP headers where each key is a header name and value is the header content.\n    - `payload` - the formatted object used as the response payload (stringified). Can be directly manipulated but any\n      changes will be lost\n      if `reformat()` is called. Any content allowed and by default includes the following content:\n        - `statusCode` - the HTTP status code, derived from `error.output.statusCode`.\n        - `error` - the HTTP status message (e.g. 'Bad Request', 'Internal Server Error') derived from `statusCode`.\n        - `message` - the error message derived from `error.message`.\n- inherited `Error` properties.\n\nThe `Boom` object also supports the following method:\n\n### `reformat(debug)`\n\nRebuilds `error.output` using the other object properties where:\n\n- `debug` - a Boolean that, when `true`, causes Internal Server Error messages to be left in tact. Defaults to `false`, meaning that Internal Server Error messages are redacted.\n\nNote that `Boom` object will return `true` when used with `instanceof Boom`, but do not use the\n`Boom` prototype (they are either plain `Error` or the error prototype passed in). This means\n`Boom` objects should only be tested using `instanceof Boom` or `Boom.isBoom()` but not by looking\nat the prototype or contructor information. This limitation is to avoid manipulating the prototype\nchain which is very slow.\n\n## Helper Methods\n\n### `new Boom(message, [options])`\n\nCreates a new `Boom` object using the provided `message` and then calling\n[`boomify()`](#boomifyerr-options) to decorate the error with the `Boom` properties, where:\n- `message` - the error message. If `message` is an error, it is the same as calling\n  [`boomify()`](#boomifyerr-options) directly.\n- `options` - and optional object where:\n\t- `statusCode` - the HTTP status code. Defaults to `500` if no status code is already set.\n    - `data` - additional error information (assigned to `error.data`).\n    - `decorate` - an option with extra properties to set on the error object.\n    - `ctor` - constructor reference used to crop the exception call stack output.\n    - if `message` is an error object, also supports the other [`boomify()`](#boomifyerr-options)\n      options.\n\n### `boomify(err, [options])`\n\nDecorates an error with the `Boom` properties where:\n- `err` - the `Error` object to decorate.\n- `options` - optional object with the following optional settings:\n\t- `statusCode` - the HTTP status code. Defaults to `500` if no status code is already set and `err` is not a `Boom` object.\n\t- `message` - error message string. If the error already has a message, the provided `message` is added as a prefix.\n\t  Defaults to no message.\n    - `decorate` - an option with extra properties to set on the error object.\n\t- `override` - if `false`, the `err` provided is a `Boom` object, and a `statusCode` or `message` are provided,\n\t  the values are ignored. Defaults to `true` (apply the provided `statusCode` and `message` options to the error\n\t  regardless of its type, `Error` or `Boom` object).\n\n```js\nvar error = new Error('Unexpected input');\nBoom.boomify(error, { statusCode: 400 });\n```\n\n### `isBoom(err)`\n\nIdentifies whether an error is a `Boom` object. Same as calling `instanceof Boom`.\n\n## HTTP 4xx Errors\n\n### `Boom.badRequest([message], [data])`\n\nReturns a 400 Bad Request error where:\n- `message` - optional message.\n- `data` - optional additional error data.\n\n```js\nBoom.badRequest('invalid query');\n```\n\nGenerates the following response payload:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"statusCode\": 400,\n    \"error\": \"Bad Request\",\n    \"message\": \"invalid query\"\n}\n```\n\n### `Boom.unauthorized([message], [scheme], [attributes])`\n\nReturns a 401 Unauthorized error where:\n- `message` - optional message.\n- `scheme` can be one of the following:\n  - an authentication scheme name\n  - an array of string values. These values will be separated by ', ' and set to the 'WWW-Authenticate' header.\n- `attributes` - an object of values to use while setting the 'WWW-Authenticate' header. This value is only used\n  when `scheme` is a string, otherwise it is ignored. Every key/value pair will be included in the\n  'WWW-Authenticate' in the format of 'key=\"value\"' as well as in the response payload under the `attributes` key.  Alternatively value can be a string which is use to set the value of the scheme, for example setting the token value for negotiate header.  If string is used message parameter must be null.\n  `null` and `undefined` will be replaced with an empty string. If `attributes` is set, `message` will be used as\n  the 'error' segment of the 'WWW-Authenticate' header. If `message` is unset, the 'error' segment of the header\n  will not be present and `isMissing` will be true on the error object.\n\nIf either `scheme` or `attributes` are set, the resultant `Boom` object will have the\n'WWW-Authenticate' header set for the response.\n\n```js\nBoom.unauthorized('invalid password');\n```\n\nGenerates the following response:\n\n```json\n\"payload\": {\n    \"statusCode\": 401,\n    \"error\": \"Unauthorized\",\n    \"message\": \"invalid password\"\n},\n\"headers\" {}\n```\n\n```js\nBoom.unauthorized('invalid password', 'sample');\n```\n\nGenerates the following response:\n\n```json\n\"payload\": {\n    \"statusCode\": 401,\n    \"error\": \"Unauthorized\",\n    \"message\": \"invalid password\",\n    \"attributes\": {\n        \"error\": \"invalid password\"\n    }\n},\n\"headers\" {\n  \"WWW-Authenticate\": \"sample error=\\\"invalid password\\\"\"\n}\n```\n\n```js\nBoom.unauthorized(null, 'Negotiate', 'VGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3QgdG9rZW4=');\n```\n\nGenerates the following response:\n\n```json\n\"payload\": {\n    \"statusCode\": 401,\n    \"error\": \"Unauthorized\",\n    \"attributes\": \"VGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3QgdG9rZW4=\"\n},\n\"headers\" {\n  \"WWW-Authenticate\": \"Negotiate VGhpcyBpcyBhIHRlc3QgdG9rZW4=\"\n}\n```\n\n```js\nBoom.unauthorized('invalid password', 'sample', { ttl: 0, cache: null, foo: 'bar' });\n```\n\nGenerates the following response:\n\n```json\n\"payload\": {\n    \"statusCode\": 401,\n    \"error\": \"Unauthorized\",\n    \"message\": \"invalid password\",\n    \"attributes\": {\n        \"error\": \"invalid password\",\n        \"ttl\": 0,\n        \"cache\": \"\",\n        \"foo\": \"bar\"\n    }\n},\n\"headers\" {\n  \"WWW-Authenticate\": \"sample ttl=\\\"0\\\", cache=\\\"\\\", foo=\\\"bar\\\", error=\\\"invalid password\\\"\"\n}\n```\n\n### `Boom.paymentRequired([message], [data])`\n\nReturns a 402 Payment Required error where:\n- `message` -

It's mostly for security and to not leak any important information back to the client. This means you will need to put in a little more effort to include extra information about your custom error.
