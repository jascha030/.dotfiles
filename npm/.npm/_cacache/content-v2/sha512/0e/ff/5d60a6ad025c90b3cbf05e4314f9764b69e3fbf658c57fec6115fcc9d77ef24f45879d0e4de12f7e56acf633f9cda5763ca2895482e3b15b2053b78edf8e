Pass an empty object as the first arg to shallow clone.\n\nFollow this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), for updates on this project and others.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save mixin-object\n```\n\nIf you only want to combine own-properties, use [extend-shallow](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow).\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar mixin = require('mixin-object');\n\nvar obj = {c: 'c'};\nvar foo = mixin({a: 'a'}, {b: 'b'});\nconsole.log(foo);\n//=> {c: 'c', a: 'a', b: 'b'}\nconsole.log(obj);\n//=> {c: 'c'}\n\nmixin({}, {a: 'a'}, {b: 'b'});\n//=> {a: 'a', b: 'b'}\n```\n\n## About\n\n### Related projects\n\nYou might also be interested in these projects:\n\n* [assign-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/assign-deep): Deeply assign the enumerable properties and/or es6 Symbol properies of source objects to the target… [more](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/assign-deep) | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/assign-deep \"Deeply assign the enumerable properties and/or es6 Symbol properies of source objects to the target (first) object.\")\n* [defaults-deep](https://www.npmjs.com/package/defaults-deep): Like `extend` but recursively copies only the missing properties/values to the target object. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/defaults-deep \"Like `extend` but recursively copies only the missing properties/values to the target object.\")\n* [extend-shallow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extend-shallow): Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util. | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow \"Extend an object with the properties of additional objects. node.js/javascript util.\")\n* [for-in](https://www.npmjs.com/package/for-in): Iterate over the own and inherited enumerable properties of an object, and return an object… [more](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/for-in) | [homepage](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/for-in \"Iterate over the own and inherited enumerable properties of an object, and return an object with properties that evaluate to true from the callback.
