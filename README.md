"One freshly squeezed Mac install, coming up!"

### Prerequisites

brew install rcm
```

## Epic backstory

I originally created this repo because _early-2020-R-tarded-me_ was "Annoyed by all that clutter in my finder with hidden files visibile...".

A _slightly-less-R-tarded-early-2021-not-using-finder-anymore-me_ created a new dotfiles repo which was a good repo, but cluttered and upon installing my new mac in late 2021 I found that the "easy-setup aspect" was not working as good as I hoped.

After a colleague made a remark about now using stow in [his dotfiles repo](https://github.com/V1RE/dotfiles), it still took about three weeks for my _genius-but-often-still-R-tarded-brain_ to go _1+1=2_ and connect the **DOTS**... 

**Update March 2022**

And now we replaced stow with rcup, because I like the clean directory structure.
