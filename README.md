# Jascha030's dotfiles

[My](https://github.com/jascha030) personal Dotfiles repository, a collection of configuration files that are used to personalize and configure my development environment and applications.

## Includes but not limited to

- 📝 [Neovim Config](https://github.com/jascha030/.dotfiles/blob/main/config/nvim/README.md)
- 💾 [ZShell (ZSH) Config](https://github.com/jascha030/.dotfiles/blob/main/config/zsh/README.md)
- 📦 Package management for MacOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- 🥄 Automation, hotkeys and custom window management for MacOS using [Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/).
- 💽 Configs for multiple terminal emulators
  - ⚡ WezTerm
  - 👻 Ghostty
- 🪄 Many scripts for making my life easier, scaring my colleagues and making my friends believe I am a _Hackerman_.
- 💩 Absolutely not a single tool for managing symlinks like [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/), instead I just `ln -s` by hand because I f-d up once, and now I have trust issues.
